Amending a principle in this constitution's authoritative text **MUST** be mirrored in its corresponding fragment file (under `fragments/`, declared in `manifest.json`'s `atoms.behavior`) in the same commit. A principle change without a matching fragment update is incomplete: it leaves the machine-composed `.spaex.md` diverged from the human-readable text it is supposed to derive from.
